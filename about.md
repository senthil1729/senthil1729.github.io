Hi, I'm Senthil Kumar, previously worked as a Jr. Geospatial Data Scientist at [Dimitra Technology](https://dimitra.io/) where I built landcover maps and deforestation detection models using classic ML algorithms for satellite imageries and LSTM model for [NDVI prediction](https://github.com/senthil1729/NDVI-time-series-analysis). I have interned at [Microlabs](https://microserv.in/), where we built an open-source library [PyHRM](https://github.com/FEUSION/PyHRM) and an automation tool [Extractor](https://github.com/FEUSION/Extractor). I've finished my master's in Data Analytics at Bharathiar University and bachelors' in Mathematics at Bishop Heber College.
