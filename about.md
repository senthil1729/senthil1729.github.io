Hi, I'm Senthil Kumar, a Jr. Geospatial Data Scientist at [Dimitra Technology](https://dimitra.io/) building landcover maps and deforestation detection models using classic ML algorithms using satellite imageries. I have interned at [Microlabs](https://microserv.in/), where we built an open-source library [PyHRM](https://github.com/FEUSION/PyHRM) and an automation tool [Extractor](https://github.com/FEUSION/Extractor). I've finished my master's in Data Analytics at Bharathiar University and bachelors' in Mathematics at Bishop Heber College.

Currently, I'm exploring and learning the AI4Geo field and contributing to the GeoML open-source projects.

If you are interested in collaborations on AI/ML projects, please contact me at [senthilkumarnallendran@gmail.com](mailto:senthilkumarnallendran@gmail.com)
